# Camera plane
Import an image and parent it to the camera. You can then set the distance and width from the image object's properties. The plane will adjust to the camera's FOV or focal length.  
You can easily import several images at once, which will be equally spaced in depth. This is useful when creating painted stage-like sets which need to stick to a camera.

Two settings are available upon selecting a plane:
* `distance` is the distance from the camera to the plane
* `passepartout` is an additional scale for the plane

Two focal settings with the same plane.
